## Main information

This project contains Python scripts, which approximate (recreate) a given image with the use of AI-related methods. At this point, I do not plan to use generative models to generate images on the fly, I consider the image re-creation task as a sequential one. This point of view allows me to use evolutionary algorithms and RL to approximate an image.
